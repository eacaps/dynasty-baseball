His 55 home runs and 45 stolen bases since the beginning of 2019 both ranked among the top eight in baseball, and in 2020, he became the first player in history to manage at least 75 home runs and 50 stolen bases through his first 300 career games. Still, his contact skills are lacking, as his 27.0% strikeout rate from 2019-20 was noticeably worse than the major league average, and that helps explain how Acuna batted just .274 during that time and finished exactly 23 ranking spots worse in total fantasy points than on the Player Rater in each of those two seasons. Spending the first pick on him in a dynasty or keeper league is a no-brainer, considering his still-advancing skill set, and in a 2021 rotisserie league it's a reasonable calculation, but he's more of a ?top-10 candidate? in points leagues that draft fresh annually.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":160.0,"1":40.0,"2":0.25,"3":11.0,"4":0.0,"5":14.0,"6":25.0,"7":15.0,"8":93.0,"9":0.58125,"10":38.0,"11":2.0,"12":4.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":202.0,"17":0.40594059,"18":0.98719059,"19":36.63636364,"20":46.0,"21":29.0,"22":5.0,"23":8.0,"24":1.0,"25":7.0,"26":3.0,"27":60.0,"28":884.0,"29":4.37623762,"31":0.0,"67":102.0,"68":102.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":27.0,"75":19.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":46.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":588.0,"1":166.0,"2":0.282312925,"3":28.0,"4":2.0,"5":37.0,"6":67.0,"7":99.0,"8":309.0,"9":0.525510204,"10":79.0,"11":4.0,"12":9.0,"13":2.0,"15":2.0,"16":679.0,"17":0.374631268,"18":0.900141473,"20":119.0,"21":91.0,"23":31.0,"24":8.0,"25":23.0,"26":9.0,"27":176.0,"81":152.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":218.0,"1":61.0,"2":0.279816514,"3":10.0,"4":1.0,"5":15.0,"6":26.0,"7":35.0,"8":118.0,"9":0.541284404,"10":26.0,"11":1.0,"12":3.0,"13":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":249.0,"17":0.362903226,"18":0.904187629,"20":42.0,"21":34.0,"23":12.0,"24":3.0,"25":9.0,"26":3.0,"27":66.0,"81":56.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":5,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":31187,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":31187,"keeperValue":9,"keeperValueFuture":12,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":9,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":15,"published":false,"rank":59,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[10,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Nick","fullName":"Nick Castellanos","id":31187,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Castellanos","lastNewsDate":1614965212000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":14.265944645006018,"averageDraftPosition":67.47177343896202,"percentChange":0.3687746389803124,"percentOwned":98.71326125504103,"percentStarted":96.268457639619},"proTeamId":17,"seasonOutlook":"For years now, Castellanos' underlying metrics have the look of a borderline MVP candidate. He gets good lift on the ball and he makes extremely hard contact, his career-best 46.7% hard hit rate in 2020 in the 83th percentile and his Statcast Barrel rate in at worst the 92nd�percentile in each of the past four seasons. Castellanos seemed on track for award votes in his first few weeks of 2020, hitting nine home runs with a .272 batting average and 1.043 OPS in his first 22 games, but he cooled thereafter, hitting only .185/.235/.370 in the month of September. It was yet another of those hard-luck final stat lines for the veteran outfielder, and while his pattern of falling short of expectations might concern prospective fantasy managers, they do help make him a relative value, especially in points-based leagues, where his skill set is a little more attractive. Castellanos is a bona fide 30-homer candidate without one yet on his r�sum�, with Great American Ball Park's cozy confines helping his cause, and he should be drafted with confidence within the top 75 overall in any format.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":218.0,"1":49.0,"2":0.22477064,"3":11.0,"4":2.0,"5":14.0,"6":27.0,"7":22.0,"8":106.0,"9":0.48623853,"10":19.0,"11":1.0,"12":4.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":242.0,"17":0.29752066,"18":0.78375919,"19":30.41350211,"20":37.0,"21":34.0,"22":2.0,"23":0.0,"24":2.0,"25":-2.0,"26":5.0,"27":69.0,"28":937.0,"29":3.87190083,"31":1.0,"67":82.0,"68":78.0,"69":1.0,"70":1.0,"71":0.96341463,"72":3.0,"73":0.0,"74":31.0,"75":29.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":60.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":607.0,"1":166.0,"2":0.273476112,"3":47.0,"4":4.0,"5":31.0,"6":82.0,"7":84.0,"8":314.0,"9":0.517298188,"10":47.0,"11":2.0,"12":7.0,"13":3.0,"15":3.0,"16":664.0,"17":0.331325301,"18":0.848623489,"20":93.0,"21":84.0,"23":2.0,"24":3.0,"25":-1.0,"26":11.0,"27":163.0,"81":155.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":211.0,"1":61.0,"2":0.289099526,"3":18.0,"4":1.0,"5":10.0,"6":29.0,"7":32.0,"8":111.0,"9":0.52606635,"10":16.0,"11":1.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":230.0,"17":0.343478261,"18":0.869544611,"20":33.0,"21":30.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":4.0,"27":52.0,"81":53.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":33184,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":33184,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":1,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":6,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":19,"published":false,"rank":42,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[4,6,19,12,16,17],"firstName":"Tim","fullName":"Tim Anderson","id":33184,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Anderson","lastNewsDate":1616492690000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":17.43080625752106,"averageDraftPosition":53.337390761548065,"percentChange":0.04875680389950787,"percentOwned":99.00142877329607,"percentStarted":93.2470835753874},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"Anderson's batting average has been far north of .300 the past two seasons. Expecting regression seems like an easy call considering he hardly ever walks and sports an average exit velocity in the lower-third percentile but while Anderson's average is likely to drop, the landing could be softer than many expect. Parsing his exit velocity into components, he hits line drives and flyballs at an above-average clip. It's a below-normal groundball velocity lowering the overall average. The elevated exit velocity on lofted balls leads to more hits while Anderson's speed keeps his groundball BABIP above the norm, rendering him a legit .300 hitter. Add in his high exit velocity on fly balls which helps power and an 80% career stolen base success rate, and Anderson heads up the second tier at a loaded position.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":208.0,"1":67.0,"2":0.32211538,"3":11.0,"4":1.0,"5":10.0,"6":22.0,"7":45.0,"8":110.0,"9":0.52884615,"10":10.0,"11":0.0,"12":2.0,"13":1.0,"14":0.0,"15":1.0,"16":221.0,"17":0.35746606,"18":0.88631222,"19":38.85321101,"20":45.0,"21":21.0,"22":3.0,"23":5.0,"24":2.0,"25":3.0,"26":4.0,"27":50.0,"28":786.0,"29":3.55656109,"31":0.0,"67":180.0,"68":65.0,"69":109.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.96666667,"72":6.0,"73":23.0,"74":30.0,"75":19.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":49.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":573.0,"1":173.0,"2":0.301919721,"3":33.0,"4":1.0,"5":21.0,"6":55.0,"7":118.0,"8":271.0,"9":0.472949389,"10":21.0,"12":4.0,"13":2.0,"15":2.0,"16":600.0,"17":0.33,"18":0.802949389,"20":97.0,"21":61.0,"23":18.0,"24":5.0,"25":13.0,"26":13.0,"27":133.0,"81":141.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":213.0,"1":59.0,"2":0.276995305,"3":13.0,"4":1.0,"5":7.0,"6":21.0,"7":38.0,"8":95.0,"9":0.44600939,"10":8.0,"12":1.0,"13":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":223.0,"17":0.304932735,"18":0.750942125,"20":30.0,"21":23.0,"23":5.0,"24":2.0,"25":3.0,"26":5.0,"27":50.0,"81":54.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":1},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":14,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":33709,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":33709,"keeperValue":16,"keeperValueFuture":9,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":27,"published":false,"rank":24,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Aaron","fullName":"Aaron Nola","id":33709,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Nola","lastNewsDate":1616443672000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":27.570737605804112,"averageDraftPosition":25.173828735847877,"percentChange":0.04249996538710832,"percentOwned":99.74381139489195,"percentStarted":98.9328094302554},"proTeamId":22,"seasonOutlook":"Quietly, Nola has become one of the game's most consistent, durable starters.

Nola also has a 3.23 ERA and 3.41 FIP in the past four seasons combined, never wavering by more than two-thirds of a run in either in any individual year, which signals a high degree of likelihood that he'll deliver on a top-10 fantasy starting pitching stat line. He even boosted his strikeout rate to a personal-best 33.2% last season, and while the small-sample caveat is apt, he had the underlying metrics in support of it being close to his new standard. Nola's upper-end projection probably isn't good enough to bring in first-place Cy Young votes, but the volume he offers can be plenty handy in fantasy.

The limited playing time over the past two seasons at the big-league level have been disappointing, particularly last season when he also struggled in the field with throws. The only reason Lux would go back to the minors in 2021 would be for regular playing time, but he has zero left to prove there offensively.

His changeup was excellent, limiting hitters to a .104 batting average, he whiffed nearly 30% of the hitters he faced, he generated a ground ball more than 50% of the time and he began his postseason with 18 2/3 shutout frames over parts of four starts. Anderson's success on the national stage might've inflated his fantasy draft stock, but the aforementioned traits offer plenty to like, and plenty that elevates his statistical floor, even should he be subject to adjustments in his second trip through the league. He has the skills to be a top-40 fantasy starter and might cost you less than that, and be aware that he's a building-block type for dynasty or keeper leagues.","starterStatusByProGame":{"401227089":"PROBABLE","401227172":"PROBABLE"},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":6.0,"33":6.0,"34":97.0,"35":138.0,"36":571.0,"37":21.0,"38":0.17213115,"39":14.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.08247423,"42":2.0,"43":0.26811594,"44":11.0,"45":7.0,"46":1.0,"47":1.94845361,"48":41.0,"49":11.41237113,"50":4.0,"51":0.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.6,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":3.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":3.0,"77":3.0,"78":0.0,"79":0.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.92857143}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":28.0,"33":28.0,"34":447.0,"35":633.0,"37":126.0,"38":0.227848101,"39":70.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.32,"42":4.0,"43":0.309636651,"44":73.0,"45":64.0,"46":13.0,"47":3.87,"48":178.0,"50":6.0,"53":11.0,"54":6.0,"55":0.647058824,"63":16.0,"82":2.54}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":5,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":30836,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":30836,"keeperValue":10,"keeperValueFuture":13,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":8,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":43,"published":false,"rank":5,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":false,"eligibleSlots":[9,5,12,16,17],"firstName":"Mike","fullName":"Mike Trout","id":30836,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Trout","lastNewsDate":1616604176000,"lastVideoDate":1596812970000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":47.95913461538461,"averageDraftPosition":4.158988764044944,"percentChange":0.01505635492169688,"percentOwned":99.84770696936869,"percentStarted":99.46461934592499},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Widely regarded the best player in baseball, Trout is no longer a slam dunk for the same honor in fantasy baseball. He placed outside the top 25 on the Player Rater while posting the worst full-season batting average (.281) and second-worst contact rate (71.9%) of his career in 2020, and he has missed 105 Angels games (most due to injuries) since the beginning of 2017. Still, that Trout's No. 27 Player Rater finish represented his lowest in any of his nine full big-league seasons speaks volumes about his Hall of Fame caliber skill set. Just since the beginning of 2018, his 101 home runs lead the majors, 252 runs scored rank sixth, .298 batting average and 229 RBI each rank 14th and 36 stolen bases rank 21st. It's the latter category that sparks genuine worry, as Trout attempted only two steals in 53 games in 2020, and as a 29-year-old, that's a skill unlikely to significantly rebound. His power metrics look as strong as ever, and with good luck in the health department that he should remain one of the most valuable commodities in fantasy. But with that No. 1 overall pick, it's probably wiser to go with someone younger or who steals more bases.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":199.0,"1":56.0,"2":0.28140704,"3":9.0,"4":2.0,"5":17.0,"6":28.0,"7":28.0,"8":120.0,"9":0.60301508,"10":35.0,"11":4.0,"12":3.0,"13":4.0,"14":0.0,"15":4.0,"16":241.0,"17":0.39004149,"18":0.99305657,"19":46.66666667,"20":41.0,"21":46.0,"22":5.0,"23":1.0,"24":1.0,"25":0.0,"26":1.0,"27":56.0,"28":1017.0,"29":4.21991701,"31":0.0,"67":120.0,"68":120.0,"69":0.0,"70":0.0,"71":1.0,"72":0.0,"73":0.0,"74":24.0,"75":29.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":53.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":518.0,"1":153.0,"2":0.295366795,"3":28.0,"4":4.0,"5":44.0,"6":76.0,"7":77.0,"8":321.0,"9":0.619691119,"10":116.0,"11":17.0,"12":13.0,"13":6.0,"15":6.0,"16":653.0,"17":0.431852986,"18":1.051544105,"20":115.0,"21":107.0,"23":13.0,"24":2.0,"25":11.0,"26":5.0,"27":135.0,"81":146.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":161.0,"1":48.0,"2":0.298136646,"3":9.0,"4":1.0,"5":13.0,"6":23.0,"7":25.0,"8":98.0,"9":0.60869565,"10":37.0,"11":6.0,"12":5.0,"13":1.0,"15":1.0,"16":204.0,"17":0.441176471,"18":1.049872121,"20":36.0,"21":31.0,"23":5.0,"24":1.0,"25":4.0,"26":2.0,"27":42.0,"81":47.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":1},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":39910,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":39910,"keeperValue":3,"keeperValueFuture":6,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":9,"published":false,"rank":102,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Zac","fullName":"Zac Gallen","id":39910,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"DAY_TO_DAY","lastName":"Gallen","lastNewsDate":1616545923000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":12.14993954050786,"averageDraftPosition":95.24082066679176,"percentChange":-1.3062676646058122,"percentOwned":97.91434184675835,"percentStarted":87.80825147347741},"proTeamId":29,"seasonOutlook":"Few pitchers in history can claim as good a start to a big-league career as Gallen's.

In fact, that made him one of four players, and the only pitcher, to finish top-20 overall on the Player Rater in each of the past three seasons, and along with Jacob deGrom, Cole is now the only players to finish top-eight overall in fantasy points in each of the past three years.

Devers' contact quality is excellent, ranking among the very best in the league, and it's only a matter of time before he couples massive raw power potential with what was a closer-to-.300 hitting stroke. There's an easy case to make here that he's a potential top-25 overall fantasy player across all formats, and if he slides outside of that group, scoop him up immediately.

Unfortunately, opportunity was present at the time that isn't there in 2021, as the Mets had the designated hitter role available to them, affording them the luxury of getting Smith and Pete Alonso into the same lineup. Smith did play a lot of left field, but that's not considered a regular path to playing time for him, though he absolutely warrants a regular place in a big-league lineup now. With the requisite at-bats, he can deliver yet another top-100 fantasy season regardless of format, as he has added the power stroke to his game that scouts had long hoped. The lack of the DH in the NL for 2021, however, is going to make regular at-bats a challenge.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":177.0,"1":56.0,"2":0.31638418,"3":21.0,"4":1.0,"5":10.0,"6":32.0,"7":24.0,"8":109.0,"9":0.61581921,"10":14.0,"11":0.0,"12":5.0,"13":3.0,"14":0.0,"15":3.0,"16":199.0,"17":0.37688442,"18":0.99270363,"19":39.94764398,"20":27.0,"21":42.0,"22":2.0,"23":0.0,"24":0.0,"25":0.0,"26":2.0,"27":45.0,"28":743.0,"29":3.73366834,"31":1.0,"67":178.0,"68":160.0,"69":16.0,"70":1.0,"71":0.98876404,"72":2.0,"73":12.0,"74":23.0,"75":27.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":50.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":406.0,"1":119.0,"2":0.293103448,"3":38.0,"4":1.0,"5":23.0,"6":62.0,"7":57.0,"8":228.0,"9":0.561576354,"10":37.0,"12":8.0,"13":4.0,"15":4.0,"16":455.0,"17":0.36043956,"18":0.922015914,"20":73.0,"21":84.0,"23":1.0,"24":2.0,"25":-1.0,"26":7.0,"27":102.0,"81":115.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":146.0,"1":33.0,"2":0.226027397,"3":8.0,"5":5.0,"6":13.0,"7":20.0,"8":56.0,"9":0.383561642,"10":11.0,"12":1.0,"16":158.0,"17":0.284810127,"18":0.668371769,"20":19.0,"21":16.0,"24":1.0,"25":-1.0,"26":4.0,"27":41.0,"81":49.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796244,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":0,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":30950,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":30950,"keeperValue":17,"keeperValueFuture":5,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":2,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":5,"published":false,"rank":148,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[0,12,16,17],"firstName":"Yasmani","fullName":"Yasmani Grandal","id":30950,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Grandal","lastNewsDate":1616109854000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":5.731001206272618,"averageDraftPosition":132.65156054931336,"percentChange":0.6083384535552625,"percentOwned":95.98511493530964,"percentStarted":88.58654691621656},"proTeamId":4,"seasonOutlook":"With James McCann now in New York, Grandal has the White Sox's primary catcher duties all to himself, just as he should have entering 2020.

He continued to elevate his launch angle, costing him batting average points, while striking out in a career-worst 30% of his trips to the plate. In the process, Grandal's patience-and-power approach at the plate widened his fantasy-valuation gap in rotisserie versus points-based and sabermetric leagues.

May's sinker was largely behind his 54.6% ground-ball rate, and he did make enough advances with his curveball that he could be due a big step forward in 2021. Until he can perfect an offering to dominate left-handed hitters, who have slashed .278/.357/.457 against him in the majors thus far, he's not going to become the fantasy ace many expect in the future. This looks like a pitcher who's probably one big adjustment away, and while it could come in 2021, without evidence of it on the horizon, it's probably best to draft him right around his finishing point on the Player Rater.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":12.0,"33":10.0,"34":168.0,"35":224.0,"36":866.0,"37":45.0,"38":0.2195122,"39":16.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.08928571,"42":1.0,"43":0.27678571,"44":18.0,"45":16.0,"46":9.0,"47":2.57142857,"48":44.0,"49":7.07142857,"50":2.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":3.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.75,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":1.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":3.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":9.0,"77":3.0,"78":1.0,"79":1.0,"80":0.0,"82":2.75,"83":1.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":32.0,"33":14.0,"34":327.0,"35":451.0,"37":103.0,"38":0.250608273,"39":29.0,"41":1.21,"42":9.0,"43":0.292682927,"44":51.0,"45":44.0,"46":9.0,"47":3.63,"48":95.0,"50":8.0,"51":1.0,"52":1.0,"53":8.0,"54":4.0,"55":0.666666667,"63":4.0,"82":3.28}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":19.0,"33":8.0,"34":174.0,"35":242.0,"37":56.0,"38":0.256880734,"39":16.0,"41":1.24,"42":7.0,"43":0.305785124,"44":30.0,"45":27.0,"46":7.0,"47":4.19,"48":47.0,"50":4.0,"53":4.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.666666667,"63":4.0,"82":2.94}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616634796245,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":14,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":32094,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":32094,"keeperValue":22,"keeperValueFuture":18,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":7,"published":false,"rank":120,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Dylan","fullName":"Dylan Bundy","id":32094,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Bundy","lastNewsDate":1615825057000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":6.717049576783555,"averageDraftPosition":131.93058337506258,"percentChange":1.4181822140082687,"percentOwned":92.33636335042304,"percentStarted":88.47545057088038},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Bundy came with a fair amount of hype last offseason after finally leaving his hitter-friendly home in Baltimore, and he wound up delivering. In 11 starts, he produced a long list of career bests, including ERA (3.29), WHIP (1.04), K% (27.0) and BB% (6.4). After allowing 1.7 HR/9 as an Oriole, he gave up just 0.7 HR/9 as an Angel. While the change in home park certainly played a role in his homer suppression, the rest of his stat line indicates that he paired that with a legitimate improvement in talent level. Bundy was the fourth overall pick way back in 2011, so him pitching at this new level didn't come out of nowhere.

Ryu will be 34 by Opening Day, and he's near the lower limit of velocity for an elite pitcher, but he's been strong all-around and healthy for several seasons now.","starterStatusByProGame":{"401227066":"PROBABLE"},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":12.0,"33":12.0,"34":201.0,"35":275.0,"36":1132.0,"37":61.0,"38":0.23828125,"39":17.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.1641791,"42":1.0,"43":0.28727273,"44":22.0,"45":21.0,"46":6.0,"47":2.82089552,"48":72.0,"49":9.67164179,"50":1.0,"51":0.0,"52":1.0,"53":5.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.71428571,"56":0.0,"57":0.0,"58":0.0,"59":0.0,"60":0.0,"61":0.0,"62":0.0,"63":7.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":9.0,"77":3.0,"78":0.0,"79":1.0,"80":0.0,"82":4.23529412}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":31.0,"33":31.0,"34":537.0,"35":722.0,"37":160.0,"38":0.236686391,"39":41.0,"40":2.0,"41":1.12,"42":4.0,"43":0.278393352,"44":74.0,"45":66.0,"46":19.0,"47":3.32,"48":174.0,"50":1.0,"52":2.0,"53":12.0,"54":8.0,"55":0.6,"63":20.0,"82":4.24}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":11.0,"33":11.0,"34":192.0,"35":256.0,"37":61.0,"38":0.253112033,"39":14.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.17,"42":1.0,"43":0.30078125,"44":30.0,"45":28.0,"46":9.0,"47":3.94,"48":60.0,"53":4.0,"54":3.0,"55":0.571428571,"63":6.0,"82":4.29}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":1},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616635339503,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":15,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":33618,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":33618,"keeperValue":20,"keeperValueFuture":21,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":11,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":10,"published":false,"rank":97,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,15,16,17],"firstName":"Raisel","fullName":"Raisel Iglesias","id":33618,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Iglesias","lastNewsDate":1615871554000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":8.50301568154403,"averageDraftPosition":111.44984650084581,"percentChange":0.5858033740896076,"percentOwned":95.61520690251301,"percentStarted":93.88800704081473},"proTeamId":3,"seasonOutlook":"Iglesias endured a rocky 2019 and made it clear to reporters that he was not thrilled with his usage as more than a conventional closer.

Hayes' game is well-rounded: Strong defense, good contact, decent pop, solid speed. The problem is that his performance looks better than it was, in part because of its contrast to the rest of the shortened schedule, but also because he got a lot of good fortune on balls in play, evidenced by his bloated .450 BABIP. There's statistical correction due here, and considering opposing pitchers might be more prepared for him now, it could be harsh. Hayes has bona fide five-category rotisserie ability, and his plate approach makes him equally appealing in points-based leagues, but let's not leap to All-Star starter/MVP talk just yet -- especially since his career peak is probably closer to that of a very good regular.","starterStatusByProGame":{},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":85.0,"1":32.0,"2":0.37647059,"3":7.0,"4":2.0,"5":5.0,"6":14.0,"7":18.0,"8":58.0,"9":0.68235294,"10":9.0,"11":2.0,"12":1.0,"13":0.0,"14":0.0,"16":95.0,"17":0.44210526,"18":1.1244582,"19":25.29787234,"20":17.0,"21":11.0,"22":1.0,"23":1.0,"24":0.0,"25":1.0,"26":2.0,"27":20.0,"28":393.0,"29":4.13684211,"31":0.0,"67":68.0,"68":17.0,"69":50.0,"70":0.0,"71":0.98529412,"72":1.0,"73":3.0,"74":8.0,"75":16.0,"76":0.0,"77":0.0,"81":24.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"0":530.0,"1":144.0,"2":0.271698113,"3":39.0,"4":6.0,"5":13.0,"6":58.0,"7":86.0,"8":234.0,"9":0.441509434,"10":56.0,"11":2.0,"12":6.0,"13":5.0,"14":2.0,"15":7.0,"16":599.0,"17":0.345058626,"18":0.78656806,"20":75.0,"21":64.0,"23":11.0,"24":2.0,"25":9.0,"26":11.0,"27":109.0,"81":140.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"},{"acquisitionDate":1616635339503,"acquisitionType":"DRAFT","injuryStatus":"NORMAL","lineupSlotId":16,"pendingTransactionIds":null,"playerId":31258,"playerPoolEntry":{"id":31258,"keeperValue":0,"keeperValueFuture":23,"lineupLocked":false,"onTeamId":7,"player":{"active":true,"defaultPositionId":1,"draftRanksByRankType":{"STANDARD":{"auctionValue":2,"published":false,"rank":198,"rankSourceId":0,"rankType":"STANDARD","slotId":0}},"droppable":true,"eligibleSlots":[13,14,16,17],"firstName":"Jameson","fullName":"Jameson Taillon","id":31258,"injured":false,"injuryStatus":"ACTIVE","lastName":"Taillon","lastNewsDate":1616941049000,"ownership":{"auctionValueAverage":2.1598062953995156,"averageDraftPosition":209.47909102291223,"percentChange":8.82789788466237,"percentOwned":60.902586681342875,"percentStarted":43.42479754697696},"proTeamId":10,"seasonOutlook":"The list of pitchers who have made successful returns from two Tommy John surgeries to pitch at a high level is short, but Taillon embarks upon that quest as a member of the Yankees, following his January trade from the Pirates.

Taillon might have his innings kept in check after such a lengthy absence, and we'd like to see a higher strikeout rate before anointing him a top comeback candidate.

Unfortunately, his contact in and out of the zone fell precipitously. The result was a career-high 20.7 K%, though his 10.6 BB% was more than double his career average. A four-degree increase in average launch angle suggests Segura altered his swing, but he did not achieve the increase in average exit velocity often piggybacking this approach. More concerning is Segura was just 2-for-4 on steal attempts despite 87th percentile sprint speed.

Peralta throws more innings than most reliever, making him a solid option in leagues where dominant relievers are useful.","starterStatusByProGame":{"401227121":"PROBABLE"},"stats":[{"externalId":"2021","id":"012021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":1,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"022021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":2,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"002020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"25":0.0,"32":15.0,"33":1.0,"34":88.0,"35":125.0,"36":553.0,"37":22.0,"38":0.2037037,"39":12.0,"40":0.0,"41":1.15909091,"42":3.0,"43":0.296,"44":14.0,"45":13.0,"46":2.0,"47":3.98863636,"48":47.0,"49":14.42045455,"50":2.0,"51":1.0,"52":0.0,"53":3.0,"54":1.0,"55":0.75,"56":1.0,"57":0.0,"58":1.0,"59":0.0,"60":3.0,"61":5.0,"62":0.0,"63":0.0,"64":0.0,"66":0.0,"74":0.0,"75":0.0,"76":7.0,"77":8.0,"78":1.0,"79":1.0,"80":0.0,"82":3.91666667,"83":3.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"002021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"102021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":36.0,"33":20.0,"34":405.0,"35":581.0,"37":109.0,"38":0.21541502,"39":63.0,"40":1.0,"41":1.27,"42":8.0,"43":0.296041308,"44":58.0,"45":53.0,"46":16.0,"47":3.53,"48":182.0,"50":7.0,"51":2.0,"53":5.0,"54":10.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":2.0,"58":2.0,"60":11.0,"63":7.0,"82":2.89,"83":11.0}},{"externalId":"2020","id":"102020","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2020,"statSourceId":1,"statSplitTypeId":0,"stats":{"32":13.0,"34":72.0,"35":103.0,"37":21.0,"38":0.230769231,"39":11.0,"41":1.33,"42":1.0,"43":0.330097087,"44":13.0,"45":12.0,"46":4.0,"47":4.5,"48":30.0,"50":1.0,"53":1.0,"54":2.0,"55":0.333333333,"56":1.0,"58":1.0,"60":3.0,"82":2.73,"83":3.0}},{"externalId":"2021","id":"032021","proTeamId":0,"scoringPeriodId":0,"seasonId":2021,"statSourceId":0,"statSplitTypeId":3,"stats":{}}],"universeId":2},"rosterLocked":false,"status":"ONTEAM","tradeLocked":false},"status":"NORMAL"}],"tradeReservedEntries":0}},{"id":8},{"id":9},{"id":10}]}
